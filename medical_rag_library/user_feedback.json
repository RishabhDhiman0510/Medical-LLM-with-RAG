      "question": "I broke my arm after ice skating what to do ?",
      "wrong_answer": "The first thing to do is to see a doctor, who will examine your arm and determine whether it is broken or not. If it is not broken, he or she will probably give you some advice on how to take care of it at home, and when it is time to go to the hospital for treatment, you will be given instructions on what to expect during the treatment. It is important to keep an eye on any changes in the wound, especially if there is bleeding, pus, or redness. Common Symptoms and Complications: The doctor may need to put a cast on your arm.",
      "correct_answer": "If you suspect your arm is broken, seek medical attention immediately. While waiting for care, immobilize your arm with a sling or padding, avoid moving it, and apply ice to reduce swelling. Do not try to straighten or set the bone yourself. A doctor will examine your arm, confirm the fracture with X-rays, and provide treatment such as casting, splinting, or in some cases surgery. Seek urgent care if there is severe pain, numbness, or loss of circulation in your hand or fingers."
