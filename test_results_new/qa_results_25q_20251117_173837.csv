2,How is hypertension diagnosed and classified?,"Diagnosis and classification of hypertension is a complex process that involves the assessment of blood pressures at multiple time intervals and the determination of the appropriate treatment plan. Key features of the diagnosis are the presence of high blood pressures and the absence of known causes for the elevated blood pressure levels. Blood pressure classification: Normal <120/<80 mmHg, Elevated 120-129/<80, Stage 1 Hypertension 130-139/80-89, Stage 2 Hypertension ≥140/≥90, Hypertensive Crisis >180/>120. Proper diagnosis should be determined by healthcare professionals.",The diagnosis of hypertension is made by measuring blood pressure at two different times. The classification of hypertension involves dividing patients into two groups: those with normal blood pressure and those with elevated blood pressure. Normal blood pressure is defined by the World Health Organization as a systolic reading less than 95 mm Hg and a diastolic reading less then 70 mm Hg. Elevated blood pressure means that the systolic blood pressures is 140 mm or more or the diastolic blood pressure reading is 90 mmHg or more.
3,What is the mechanism of ACE inhibitors?,"The inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by ACE inhibitors is thought to be due to competitive inhibition. Key Features: This competitive inhibition prevents the conversion to angiotensin II, which is a potent vasoconstrictor, thereby reducing vasoconstriction and aldosterone secretion leading to vasodilation and lower blood pressure. Common characteristics associated with ACE inhibitors can vary widely between different patients and their specific medical conditions.","ACE inhibitors work by blocking the activity of an enzyme called angiotensine converting enzyme (EC 3. 1) which converts angiotensin 1 (angIOTensin I) into angiotensin2 (ANGIOtEnsinII), a potent vasoconstrictor. By blocking this enzyme, ACE inhibitors increase plasma rennetng factor levels and inhibit aldosterone secretion from the adrenal glands. They also block the effects of angiontensins I and II in the kidneys and lungs, leading them to dilate and release vasodilator substances."
